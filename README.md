**BUGS & REQUESTS:**

Send me an email or open a ticket on github.

**INSTALLATION:**

Put the .lua file into the according subfolder of the VLC lua directory, by default:
* Windows (all users): %ProgramFiles%\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\sd\
* Windows (current user): %APPDATA%\VLC\lua\sd\
* Linux (all users): /usr/lib/vlc/lua/sd/
* Linux (current user): ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/sd/

Create directories if they don't exist.

Restart VLC.

---
**EXPLANATION & USAGE:**

* Stations are listed on the left panel under "Internet"
* Explore and crawls through all radio stations
* After having found one or more list(s) of specific stations it is best to copy them into the playlist and continue searching and sorting there, since the Service Discovery zone is a little limited in its capabilities, especially after having found several list of sub categories.
